# Create your own token and connect to it your contract using Alchemy

For this homework, use the smart contacts given to you and upload them to the 
[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Compile(make sure your Solidity version is correct) and deploy your token. Once deployed, make sure to get the token showing in your [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/).

Once you have your token on the Sepolia or Goreli test network, use Alchemy in
the `myToken.js` file to connect to the test network and fetch your contract details.

## Steps

1. Fork and clone
2. Deploy your contract on a test network
3. Connect to your contract using Alchemy
4. Paste the correct output from Alchemy in the `myToken.js`
